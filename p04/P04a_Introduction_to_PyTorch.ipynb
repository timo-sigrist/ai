    "The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook). Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to give you the basics particularly necessary to demonstrate how to implement the various DL methods contained in the MLDM course and at the same time still understand how PyTorch works under the hood. If you are already familiar with PyTorch and have created your own neural network projects, feel free to just skim this notebook.\n",

If you are running this notebook locally, make sure you have installed an environment with all necessary libraries and have activated it."

There are multiple ways and functions to perform matrix multiplication, some of which we list below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `torch.matmul`: Performs the matrix product over two tensors, where the specific behavior depends on the dimensions. If both inputs are matrices (2-dimensional tensors), it performs the standard matrix product. For higher dimensional inputs, the function supports broadcasting (for details see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html?highlight=matmul#torch.matmul)). Can also be written as `a @ b`, similar to numpy. \n",
    "* `torch.mm`: Performs the matrix product over two matrices, but doesn't support broadcasting (see [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.mm.html?highlight=torch%20mm#torch.mm))\n",
    "* `torch.bmm`: Performs the matrix product with a support batch dimension. If the first tensor $T$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times m$), and the second tensor $R$ ($b\\times m\\times p$), the output $O$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times p$), and has been calculated by performing $b$ matrix multiplications of the submatrices of $T$ and $R$: $O_i = T_i @ R_i$\n",
    "* `torch.einsum`: Performs matrix multiplications and more (i.e. sums of products) using the [Einstein summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) convention. \n",

    "Usually, we use `torch.matmul` or `torch.bmm`. We can try a matrix multiplication with `torch.matmul` below."

    "### Dynamic Computation Graph and Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch in Deep Learning projects is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for implementing neural networks, and they are just fancy functions. If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term for derivatives with respect to certain parameters and dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input. \n",
    "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us. Thus, we create a dynamic computation graph along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a neural net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $\\mathbf{W}$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want.\n",
    "\n",

As `matmul` operations are very common in neural networks, we can already see the great benefit of training a neural network on a GPU. The time estimate can be relatively noisy here because we haven't run it for multiple times. Feel free to extend this, but it also takes longer to run.\n",

Still, we don't want that our code gives us a different output every time we run it on the exact same hardware. Hence, we also set the seed on the GPU:"
